# API's -  Notes
This document covers the principles of API Client Programming, a key component in interacting with external data sources. The focus is on fetching and processing data from URLs. Although much of the assignment relies on URL data fetching, it's noted that modern language models can handle this automatically, reducing the need for manual intervention in some cases.
