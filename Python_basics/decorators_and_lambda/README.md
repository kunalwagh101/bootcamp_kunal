**Basic Function Decorator: Learn to write a basic decorator for a function.**

**Create a decorator named simple_logger that prints "Function started" and "Function ended" when any function is called.**
**Decorator with Arguments: Create a decorator that can take arguments.**

**Write a decorator named prefix_printer that takes a string prefix and prints it before the function's name each time the function is called.**
**Timing Decorator: Implement a decorator to measure execution time.**

**Develop a timer decorator that prints the time taken by a function to execute.Memoization Decorator: Create a decorator for caching function results**

**Write a memoize decorator that caches the return values of a function, so repeated calls with the same arguments return the cached result.Debug Information Decorator: Build a decorator to print function details.**

**Implement a debug_info decorator that prints the name of the function, its arguments, and its return value each time the function is called.Access Control Decorator: Write a decorator to restrict access to a function.**

**Create a role_required decorator that takes a user role and only allows the function to execute if the provided user has the specified role.Retry Mechanism Decorator: Implement a decorator to retry a function.**

**Develop a retry decorator that retries a function up to a specified number of times if it raises an exception.logging Decorator with Parameters: Create a decorator to log with custom messages.**

**Write a custom_logger decorator that takes a log message and prints it before and after the function execution.Class Method Decorator: Apply a decorator to class methods.**

**mplement a validate_args decorator that checks and validates the arguments passed to any class method in which it is used.Composition of Decorators: Practice combining multiple decorators.**

**Combine simple_logger, timer, and debug_info decorators in different orders on a single function and observe the output differences.Simple List Comprehension: Practice creating a list comprehension.**

**Generate a list of squares for numbers from 1 to 10 using a list comprehension.Conditional List Comprehension: Use a condition within a list comprehension.**

**Create a list of even numbers from 1 to 20 using a list comprehension with a conditional statement.Nested List Comprehension: Explore nested list comprehensions.**

**Use a nested list comprehension to flatten a matrix (a list of lists) into a single list.functools.partial Usage: Learn to use partial from the functools module.**

**Use functools.partial to create a new function that multiplies any number by 2, based on a generic multiplication function.Combining functools.reduce with Lambda: Implement reduce with a lambda function.**

**Utilize functools.reduce and a lambda function to calculate the factorial of a number.List Comprehension with Multiple Iterables: Use multiple iterables in a list comprehension.**

**Generate all possible pairs (as tuples) of numbers from two different lists using a list comprehension.functools.lru_cache for Optimization: Optimize a recursive function with lru_cache.**

**Write a recursive function to calculate Fibonacci numbers and use functools.lru_cache to optimize it.Advanced List Comprehension: Implement more complex logic in a list comprehension.**

**Create a list comprehension that transforms all strings in a list to uppercase and all integers to their square values.functools.total_ordering for Classes: Use total_ordering to simplify class comparison.**

**Create a class representing a simple 2D point (with x and y coordinates) and use functools.total_ordering to compare points based on their distance from the origin.Combining functools with List Comprehensions: Integrate functools with list comprehensions.**

**Use functools.reduce along with a list comprehension to calculate the sum of squares of numbers from 1 to 10.**


***cd in decorators_and_lambda and just run the below command and see the magic of python*** 

```
python script.py
```

***Above command will run all of the python files in data_strcutures***
