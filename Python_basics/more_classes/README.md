**Basic Class Creation: Create a simple Book class with attributes like title and author.**

**Implement the class and create instances of it.Static Method Usage: Add a static method to the Book class that validates ISBN numbers.**

**Implement and demonstrate its usage without creating an instance of Book.Class Method Implementation: Add a class method in the Book class for tracking the number of books created.**

**Implement and test this method.Using Dunder Methods: Implement the __str__ and __repr__ methods for the Book class**

**Create instances and print them to see the effect of these methods.Implementing an Abstract Base Class (ABC): Create an abstract base class Shape with an abstract method area.**

**Derive subclasses like Circle and Rectangle, implementing area in each.Contracts with @property: Implement a Temperature class that strictly controls setting and getting temperature values using @property.**

**Enforce a range for temperature values (e.g., -273.15°C to 5000°C).Using Dunder Methods for Arithmetic: Implement __add__, __sub__, and other arithmetic dunder methods in a Vector class.**

**Test the class with vector addition, subtraction, etc.Abstract Properties: Add abstract properties to an abstract base class and implement them in child classes.**

**Example: abstract class Animal with an abstract property sound Dynamic Class Creation: Dynamically create a class at runtime.**

**Use type to create a new class with dynamically specified properties.Class Decorators: Write a class decorator that adds a new method or attribute to the class.**

**Apply it to an existing class and demonstrate the added functionality.Static Variables and Methods: Explore the use of static variables and methods in a class.**

**Example: Track the number of instances created for a class using a static variable.Enforcing Interface Implementation: Create an interface using ABC and enforce its implementation in subclasses.**

**Example: An interface Streamable with method stream() and subclasses like VideoStream and AudioStream.Class Mixins: Implement and use mixins to add common functionalities to classes.**

**Example: A JsonMixin that adds JSON serialization/deserialization to classes.Operator Overloading: Overload comparison operators in a class.**

**Implement __eq__, __lt__, etc., in a class to enable direct object comparisons.Immutable Class: Create an immutable class where instances cannot be modified after creation.**

**Example: A Point class representing a point in 2D space.Custom Context Managers: Implement a class that works as a context manager using __enter__ and __exit__ dunder methods.**

**Example: A FileOpen class that opens and closes files gracefully.**


***cd in more_classes and just run the below command and see the magic of python*** 

```
python script.py
```

***Above command will run all of the python files in data_strcutures***
