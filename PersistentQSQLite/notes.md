## 2. Error Handling (Flehandeling)

Effective error handling ensures that your system can gracefully manage and recover from errors. This section discusses strategies to detect, log, and resolve errors, thereby enhancing system stability:

- **Error Detection & Logging:**  
  Understand how to identify issues as they occur and log them for analysis.

- **Handling Strategies:**  
  Discover methods for retrying failed operations and implementing fallback mechanisms.

- **Practical Fixes:**  
  Review working examples (including fixes initiated via Poetry) that demonstrate how to overcome common errors.

- **Resilience in Production:**  
  See how robust error handling can prevent system downtime and improve user experience.

## 3. Use of Queue

Queues are used to decouple tasks and manage asynchronous processing. They help in distributing workloads and improving system responsiveness. In this section, you will learn:

- **Queue Fundamentals:**  
  Get an overview of what queues are and why they are essential for managing tasks asynchronously.

- **Practical Examples:**  
  Review examples of sending tasks to a queue, including how to handle task distribution and processing.

- **Real-World Scenarios:**  
  Explore use cases where implementing a queue leads to better scalability and fault tolerance.

- **Error & Retry Mechanisms:**  
  Understand how queues integrate with error handling to retry failed tasks without blocking the system.
