**Familiarize yourself with basic data structures by creating lists and dictionaries for bus routes and train lines.Create a list of bus routes.Create a dictionary mapping train lines to their respective stations.Use sets to handle unique elements in the transportation system.Create a set of all unique stations in the system.Understand nested data structures by organizing schedules.Create a dictionary where each key is a route, and the value is a list of tuples representing scheduled stops (time, station).Aggregate data from different structures.Calculate the total number of unique stations served by both buses and trains.Implement named tuples for more structured data.Define a named tuple Schedule with fields for time and station.Refactor the earlier schedules to use Schedule named tuples.Explore default dictionaries for handling missing keys gracefully.Create a default dictionary for tracking the number of passengers per station.Handle complex nesting in data structures.Create a nested data structure that maps a transport line to its schedule, and each schedule to a list of passengers (by name).Utilize Counter from the collections module to analyze data.Use a Counter to find the most frequented stations in the network.Apply custom sorting to collection data.Sort the bus routes based on the number of stops, using a custom sorting function.Combine different data structures to model a comprehensive transportation system.Create a class TransportNetwork that integrates all the previous data structures and provides methods to add routes, update schedules, and add passengers.**


***cd in data_structues and just run the below command and see the magic of python*** 

```
python script.py
```

***Above command will run all of the python files in data_strcutures***
