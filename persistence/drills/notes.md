## Example ex1_1_2: Persistence Drills

This problem  demonstrates how to implement persistence drills in a Streamlit application. It focuses on maintaining state across sessions, enabling you to debug and verify persistent behaviors interactively.

- **Purpose:**  
  Learn how to ensure that state data remains consistent across user interactions.
- **Key Concepts:**  
  Persistence, state management, and real-time debugging.
- **Output:**  
  A live demonstration of persistence mechanisms in a Streamlit app.

## Example ex2: API Interaction Demo

This problem showcases how to send and receive API calls within a Streamlit application. It is designed to help you integrate external services and display dynamic data from API responses.

- **Purpose:**  
  Demonstrate the integration of external APIs in a user-friendly interface.
- **Key Concepts:**  
  API calls, data fetching, and interactive data display.
- **Output:**  
  A working example that sends a request and presents the received data.
